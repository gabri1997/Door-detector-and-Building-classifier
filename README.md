# Door Detector and Building Classifier

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Computer Vision and Cognitive System** course during the **UNIMORE 2020/2021 academic year**. It explores building recognition and entrance detection through neural networks and image retrieval techniques. For detailed insights, please refer to the full project report.

## Project Goals üîç

The aim of this work is twofold:
1. **Building Classification**: Classify building types using a neural network.  
2. **Door Detection**: Identify entrances in images using object detection.  

Additionally, the project incorporates **image retrieval** to compare alternative approaches to classification, applying image processing techniques and feature extraction.

## 1. Introduction
Neural networks have the potential to improve everyday life significantly and can assist individuals with specific needs. This project exemplifies such applications in computer vision.

## 2. Building Classification

### 2.1 Dataset for ResNet
Since no suitable dataset was available, we created a custom one by collecting 1,300 images from stock websites and organizing them into five classes:
- House  
- Flat complex  
- Church  
- Historical buildings/monuments  
- Shops  

To ensure balance, we curated the dataset so each class contained approximately the same number of images. 

### 2.2 Model Selection
We employed **ResNet** (Residual Network) for building classification. The final layer was modified to output a `[1, 5]` matrix, representing the five building classes. Fine-tuning was achieved by freezing the initial layers and retraining the last 19 layers.  

#### Experimentation
- Models tested: **ResNet18**, **ResNet34**, **ResNet50**, and **ResNet152**.  
- Optimization: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) vs. Adam optimizer.  
- Best result: **ResNet34** with a learning rate of 0.005, optimized using SGD.

## 3. Door Detection

The dataset from the building classification task was annotated for door positions using **LabelImg**. We employed **YOLOv2** (You Only Look Once) for door detection, fine-tuning it on approximately 1,000 images. YOLOv2 was chosen for its speed, though it is less accurate than region-proposal architectures.

## 4. Image Retrieval

### Approaches
Two methods for image retrieval were tested:
1. **ORB Features**: Using Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF descriptors.  
2. **Neural Network Features**: Extracting features from the ResNet's last layer before the fully connected layer.

### Dataset Processing
The images underwent preprocessing steps:
- Resizing to 400√ó400 pixels  
- Grayscale conversion  
- Histogram equalization  
- Bilateral filtering  

### Retrieval Methodology
Features were extracted, and similarity between query and dataset images was computed using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**. Query expansion involved applying geometric transformations (rotation, perspective, WARP) to enhance feature matching.

## Results

### Key Findings:
1. **Building Classification**: ResNet34 achieved robust performance.  
2. **Door Detection**: YOLOv2 produced good results but showed room for improvement.  
3. **Image Retrieval**: Neural network features provided more stable results compared to ORB.  

#### Examples of Results:
- **Figure 6**: Good retrieval with ORB, ResNet, and YOLO; network-based retrieval failed.  
- **Figure 7**: Excellent door detection but incorrect retrieval and classification.  
- **Figure 8**: Accurate classification and retrieval; low door detection confidence.  
- **Figure 9**: Classification and network-based retrieval succeeded, but door detection and ORB retrieval failed.
